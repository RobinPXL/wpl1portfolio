    projectParagraph1: "My idea for this assignment started a bit differently. The teachers told us to look for societal issues that have produced a lot of data. But I wanted to, more importantly, tell a story. I also know what my strengths are when it comes to telling stories visualy: illustrating animals. So naturally, I went looking for any potential endangered species. There were a lot, but I also needed to find reliable data and find my silver lining in it all. That's how I found out that in Belgium we eat a lot of fish that are endangered. Most people think of tuna or salmon which I did as well. But upon further investigation, I found out that sharks were eaten in relatively large quantities.",
    projectParagraph2: "For a week, I looked up valuable information and thought about in which angle I wanted to tell this story. After thinking a bit, I came to the realisation that a lot of people are afraid of sharks. Full stop. This gave me the perfect opportunity to look for statistics and information that weakens the fear of sharks. Info such as: how misrepresented sharks are in the media, what sharks do eat, why sharks are being killed, how old sharks are and why that matters... In the meantime, I think it was important to also find a suitable color palette. That was the most trickiest part. I did not want to make a blue poster, but at the same time, it was the most familiar thing for people. Thinking about it further, I thought that red as a main color would be perfect to convey the cruelty on sharks.",
    projectParagraph3: "I worked for 3 days on the illustrations of sharks, slicing them away from images on Unsplash and adding my own twists to them. It was so satisfying when everything came together. The colors, the compostion and the text made it all so exciting to look at. My poster helped some people to get over their fear of sharks and be advocates for them instead. I think this worked out absolutely amazing!",

    projectParagraph1: "In the autumn months of 2021, I really liked the idea of mushroom hunting. Not that I would do anything with the mushrooms, except capture them on my phone. But I was interested in mycology at the time and mushrooms had gotten a hold of me for some reason. My partner was supportive of my obsession at the time and she took me to a forest close by to her place. I had seen so many mushrooms and photographed even more.",
    projectParagraph2: "Coming back to Brussels, I needed to walk my dog Billy. And despite being hesitant to go on a walk on a route he was unfamiliar with, he soon dide really like the park nearby our house. I took him on many little corners of the park and we took pictures of both him and the mushrooms.",
    projectParagraph3: "His ginger coat almost blended with the leaves on the floor and sometimes he would hide in them, much to my confusion. He did listen when I called him back to me and we had a wonderful day at the park together.",
